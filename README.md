## Introduction

Depression is a serious mental health condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Social media platforms like Twitter provide a rich source of data that can be analyzed to detect early signs of depression. This project uses machine learning techniques to analyze tweets and predict the likelihood of depression in users.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of tweets collected from Twitter. The data includes:
- Tweet content
- User metadata
- Labels indicating depressive or non-depressive content

### Data Preprocessing

Before training the models, the data undergoes several preprocessing steps, including:
- Text cleaning (removal of URLs, mentions, hashtags, etc.)
- Tokenization
- Stop words removal
- Lemmatization

## Installation

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/depression-detection.git
   cd depression-detection
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:** Ensure you have the dataset in the correct format and location. Modify the configuration file if necessary.

2. **Training the Model:** Run the training script to train the machine learning model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

3. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using the test dataset:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

4. **Prediction:** Use the trained model to make predictions on new data:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --input_file path/to/input.csv --output_file path/to/output.csv
   ```

## Model Training and Evaluation

### Training

The training process involves:
- Splitting the dataset into training and test sets
- Vectorizing the text data using techniques like TF-IDF
- Training various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest)
- Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search or Random Search

### Evaluation

The models are evaluated using metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC

## Results

The project provides detailed performance metrics for each model, including confusion matrices and ROC curves. The results section includes a comparison of different models and their effectiveness in detecting depression.
